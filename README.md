# Hearing Trainer (Elm Edition)
Hearing Trainer is a game design to help you fine tune your hearing skills. This is accomplish by playing a game where you are given a music note, and you have to guess the note from a list of options.

## Roadmap
- Add a score system.
- Add difficulty levels, where the easiest level just makes you guess contiguous notes. The next level will make you guess notes that are 1 or 2 steps apart. Etc.

## Directory Structure
This project was bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
